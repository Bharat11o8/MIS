 *              hold a part number for. NULL when the source file predates the
 *              three-series format and simply didn't say.
 *   ys_sale    "YS SC Sale" — what we actually sold them
 *
 * and the three ratios read off it. `penetration` ("YS Share" on screen) is
 * the headline and its denominator is ysasc, so it is null whenever ysasc is.
 *
 * oem_total is nullable for a bigger reason than a missing cell: not every OEM
 * publishes one. TATA's tab gives a target and an achievement and never says
 * how much the dealer sold, so for TATA the whole funnel is unavailable rather
 * than zero — hence `Capabilities.funnel`, which decides whether a panel built
 * on these figures is drawn at all. Never render a null here as 0.

 *  "Opportunity" and "Behind target". A name that states a DIRECTION pins the
 *  sign to it: "Opportunity +500" can only mean 500 units of upside, so once +
 *  means ahead the old name fights the number. "vs X" is neutral and lets the
 *  sign carry the meaning.
 *
 *  Each ranking still says what BOTH of its ends mean, because for a signed
 *  metric the bottom is not "the worst" in the way a reader assumes — it is the
 *  list to WORK, which is the more useful end and the one the table opens on.
 *
 *  `floor` marks the rankings whose bottom end is meaningless without a volume
