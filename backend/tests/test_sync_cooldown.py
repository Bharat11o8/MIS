"""
The Sync cooldown.

Reps can press Sync, and the row lock only stops runs that literally overlap.
Six people pressing twenty seconds apart do not overlap, so each one used to
pull all four sheets in full — the API cost of a rush without any of the
concurrency. The cooldown closes that gap.

What it must NOT do is lock somebody out of their own data. A rep who has just
filed a visit and presses Sync needs either the pull or an honest answer about
when the last one happened, never a flat "up to date". So the window is short,
only a SUCCESSFUL pull suppresses the next one, and the admin's per-source sync
ignores the cooldown entirely.
