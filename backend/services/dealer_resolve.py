AutoForm MIS — resolving a logged dealership to a dealer OUTLET.

Every visit-log row names a dealership and a city as free-ish text. The dealer
view needs those rows attached to a specific outlet in `oe_dealerships`, because
one group can run several (PREM MOTORS Narela vs PREM MOTORS Wazirpur) and
leadership asks its questions per outlet: coverage, top/bottom 20, growth.

Matching is not a straight equality check for two reasons:

  • History. Until Aug 2026 the form filled City from a public geo API, picked
    independently of the dealership, so its spellings are the API's and the
    dealer list's are the OE team's — Bengaluru/BANGALORE, Ambāla/AMBALA,
    Guwhati/GUWAHATI, Bhubaneswar/BHUBANESHWAR. About 39% of August's rows
    disagree on city while naming the right dealer.
  • Names carry trade noise (PVT / LTD / LLP) inconsistently on both sides, and
    the pre-dropdown era is full of truncations — "Anand Motors" for ANAND
    MOTOR, "Poddar Car" for PODDAR CAR WORLD, "Bimal Auto" for BIMAL AUTO
    AGENCY.
  • Some cities were renamed rather than misspelt. Bengaluru scores 0.667
    against BANGALORE and Prayagraj 0.333 against ALLAHABAD — no similarity
    threshold can catch those without also accepting genuinely wrong places, so
    they need naming, not scoring.

New rows do not have this problem — the form now takes the city from the chosen
dealer — so this is mostly about not throwing away the history.

The rule, in order:
  1. find the dealer by exact normalised name within the OEM; failing that, by
     name containment (one side's words are all present in the other) and only
     when exactly ONE dealer qualifies, so "BHANDARI" can't swallow a longer
     unrelated name;
  2. that dealer is in exactly ONE city → that city, whatever was typed. A
     group with a single city cannot be ambiguous, so a city typo is harmless;
  3. several cities → the best one, accepted only if it clears
     MIN_CITY_SIMILARITY *and* is clearly ahead of the runner-up. Two outlets
     of one group in similar-sounding cities is exactly where a wrong guess
     would be invisible, so we abstain instead;
  4. one city, several outlets — which happens only where the OEM's file is
     keyed per dealer code (TATA: ANANYA AUTO AGENCY / PATNA is two codes with
     two separate targets) → the ANCHOR, the lowest code of the group.

Step 4 needs saying out loud, because it is the one step that does not resolve
to the truth. A visit log names a dealership and a city and never a code, so a
contact at a two-code dealer genuinely cannot be attributed to one of them.
Spreading it, dropping it, or picking at random would each be worse: the anchor
is deterministic, so the same contact lands in the same place every sync, and
the Dealers tab reads contacts at the (oem, name, city) GROUP level so both
siblings show the visit that was really made to the dealership. Callers that
know the code — the dealer file's own sync — pass it and get an exact match
instead.

Anything unresolved stays unresolved. A NULL dealer_id is a reportable fact —
never guess to make a number look complete.
