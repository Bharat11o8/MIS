"""
AutoForm MIS — OE Network Sales Router
Five sheet types under one module ("oe_network" permission key):
  • oe_visit_plan    — one spreadsheet per calendar month, one tab per salesperson
  • oe_log_book      — one continuous Form-responses spreadsheet
  • oe_targets       — one spreadsheet per quarter, stacked OEM blocks per tab
  • oe_dealer_data   — the OE team's dealer file, one tab per OEM
  • oe_oem_targets   — one spreadsheet per FY, one tab per OEM, the brand-level
                       target summary
Registry + manual sync follow the standard sheet_sources pattern; data endpoints
are filter-first (plans list, logs list, log analytics, plan-vs-actual coverage,
dealer directory, dealer-level plan adherence). Target analytics live in
routers/oe_targets.py (per salesperson) and routers/oe_oem_targets.py (per
brand); this file owns the registry and sync for all of them.

oe_targets and oe_oem_targets are two different commitments from two different
files — the same money cut by person and cut by brand — and are never added
together or shown as one number.
