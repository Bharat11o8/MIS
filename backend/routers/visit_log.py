"""
AutoForm MIS — OE Network visit-log form (public).

Replaces the Google Form OEM salespeople used. Appends one row per submission to
the log-book responses sheet, in the exact column order the sheet already has, so
the existing OE Network sync (services/oe_network_sync.py) keeps reading it.

This endpoint is intentionally UNAUTHENTICATED — reps open a shared link, no login
— mirroring how the Google Form worked. The target sheet is set by
VISIT_LOG_SHEET_ID so the test sheet and the live sheet are a config swap, never a
code change.

Photo upload (sheet column L) is deferred to a later phase; this writes text only.
